## Notes

Since this is the first time I use Xcode and Swift, it is a bit challenge to finish the task. I think I still need sometime to be familiar them. I spend about 30 minute to find out how to add a dark mode to the app, but I only find the way to set a single view into dark mode, instead of whole app. I also got stuck when I was tring to set the custom tip rate. I think I can get over these problems in future studying.
